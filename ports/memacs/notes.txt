A couple of minor things had to be done to get this to compile and run
correctly. Both bios.h and stdio.h had to be moved to where they could be
found after being reference by #include <stdio.h>.

stdio.h is nearly identical to the DRI provided version with the addition of
lots of library function definitions at the end. Without them, some wild
pointer references result.

As a plus, it is configured out of the box to emit ANSI escape sequences
which work perfectly with an xterm.

My only complaint so far is that it does handle line wraps like real emacs
does. Hopefully there will not be too many differences. Because emaces is 
my editor of choice on Linux, that could be confusing.
